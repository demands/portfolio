    <p>While working for <a href="http://www.markerseven.com">Marker Seven</a>, I built this interactive social networking site for Artspan, a nonprofit whose mission is to support and connect artists in San Francisco. The site is tightly integrated with a CRM, so that Artspan can easily keep track of volunteers, donors, event participants, and local artists.</p>
